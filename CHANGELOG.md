### ‚ûï Added

- Settings page. Stored in cloud with cache in local storage.
  - Auto skip time. Automatically skip the exercise after a certain time.
  - WPM Decay. Used to sword words on slowest WPM.

## 2024-07-06 - 2024-07-31

### ‚ûï Added

- Target WPM can now be set to either percentage or relative to the highest WPM (used to be 100%)

### üîÑ Changed

- Improve calculation of WPM when words that begin or end with spaces are in the exercise
- Save exercise progress locally instead of in the cloud
- WPM does not update when the input is invalid

### üêõ Fixed

- Word WPM now only uses the first decimal when checking if reached target WPM. Previously there was a chance
  that the WPM was 0.01 off the target WPM, so it would display as green but was not met.
